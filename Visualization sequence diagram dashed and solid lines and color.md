I'll create a prompt format that clearly indicates we want both visualization styles for the in-order traversal:

```
Show me in-order traversal visualization for this binary tree:
{
    "value": 1,
    "left": {
        "value": 2,
        "left": {
            "value": 4,
            "left": null,
            "right": null
        },
        "right": {
            "value": 5,
            "left": null,
            "right": null
        }
    },
    "right": {
        "value": 3,
        "left": null,
        "right": null
    }
}

Required visualizations:
1. Basic binary tree with stack frame execution (mermaid graph TD)
2. Sequence diagram showing method calls:
   a) Standard version with default activation bars
   b) Enhanced version with color-coded execution scopes
```

This prompt:
1. Clearly specifies the tree structure in JSON format for easy parsing
2. Explicitly requests multiple visualization types
3. Specifies the need for both a basic and color-coded sequence diagram
4. Indicates the expected diagram types (graph TD for tree, sequence for method calls)

Would you like me to demonstrate how this prompt would be used with a different tree structure? Or would you like to refine the prompt format further?
